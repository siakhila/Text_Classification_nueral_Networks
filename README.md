# Text_Classification_nueral_Networks
This project compares K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Neural Networks for handwriting recognition using the `letters.csv` dataset. Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The **Neural Network model** outperformed KNN, achieving 70% accuracy. The repository includes code, models, and analysis for implementation.
